# Working-with-directories-using-Python
Imagine a situation where your dataset consists of 1000s of images stored and organized in a directory.How will you pre-process them and finally train your CNN or YOLO model or anything similar???How would you manage to get this data as easily as possible for your project???  You can,of course,upload the folder of images to your drive and make use of the following tips which I exclusively used for some of my projects recently.  Manipulating text file content will be very useful to convert files from XML format to YOLO format.

**CONTENTS OF THE DEMO:**

*1.Traverse through files of a directory in Google Drive*

*2.Rename files according to your convenience*

*3.Manipulating text file content*

*4.Dry Run!!!*
